    Combinos is a block-dropping puzzle game with a twist.
    The longer you play a game, the more frequently you'll
    get pieces with six, seven, or more squares.
    The basic rules are similar to Tetris:
    fill up an entire line to clear it for points.
    You will get more points for <b>clearing multiple lines</b>
    simultaneously, and for making a <b>combo</b> - that is, for scoring
    with consecutive pieces.
  </div>
  <div class="help-section">
    To play, use the arrow keys to move a block, up or Z to rotate it,
    and space to drop it in place.
    You can also rotate a block counter-clockwise with X.
    An important ability is the <b>hold</b>, which you can activate with C.
    Using the hold will swap the current block for the held block,
    which you can use to defer a bad block or save a good one.
    <b>Note that you can't use the hold twice in a row without playing!</b>

    All keyboard bindings are configurable in the Options section of the menu.

    There are two multiplayer modes available right now.
    The <b>Race</b> mode supports up to five players.
    The goal of this game mode is to get a higher score than the
    other players in the game in the time allotted.
  </div>
  <div class="help-section">
    The <b>Battle</b> mode supports only two players.
    In this mode, when you clear lines, you will attack the other player.
    Each attack does some <b>queue damage</b> and some <b>poison damage</b>.
    Queue damage adds a large block to the opponent's queue immediately,
    while poison damage permanently make their distribution a bit worse.
    <b>Big clears do extra queue damage. Combos do extra poison damage.</b>

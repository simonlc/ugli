Core server-side functionality
==============================
Timeouts
- Rethink timeouts API
- Add ability to cancel timeout
- Improve semantics (deal with concurrent update) in callback

Joining/leaving
- Add fallback notifications in case of db failure

Exceptions
- Add UGLI-specific exception for canceling state updates

Update propagation
- Minimize or squash trivial/spammy updates
- Only send updates to players when their view changes
- Keep only a single snapshot of each state around?
